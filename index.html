   <p> Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre. Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins"> Click here to learn more about Poppins. </a> </p>
   <p> Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto"> Click here to learn more about Roboto. </a> </p>

   <h2 style="font-family: Nanum Gothic;"> Nanum Gothic </h2>
   <p> Michroma is a reworking and remodelling of the rounded-square sans genre that is closely associated with a 1960s feeling of the future. This is due to the popularity of Microgramma, designed by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Buttiin in 1952, which pioneered the style; and the most famous typeface family of the genre that came 10 years later in Novarese’s Eurostile. Michroma has character widths and stem weights perfectly formed to fit today's digital screens; Vernon Adams has pioneered a design process with this font that produces excellent results on screen with no manual hinting involved. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Michroma" > Click here to learn more about Michroma. </a> </p>
   <p> Nanum Gothic is a contemporary sans-serif typeface with a warm touch, and it is expertly hinted for screen use. It is part of the Nanum fonts (나눔글꼴) – a set of high quality Unicode fonts designed especially for the Korean-language script “Hangeul” that also support Latin. Designed by Sandoll Communications (산돌 커뮤니케이션) and Fontrix (폰트릭스,) and published by Naver (네이버.)  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic"> Click here to learn more about Nanum Gothic. </a> </p>
